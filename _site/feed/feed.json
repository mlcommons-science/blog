			"content_html": "<p>The original cloudmask code contains a feature to save the training\nmodel into a file that is later used for inference. However, at the\ncurrent time, the configuration file and the associated code save this\nconfiguration file in a single location. If run in parallel the model\nwould be overwritten among parallel runs. To allow parallel execution\nof cloudmask a mechanism to run the code on a permutation of different\nparameters is used. For this we can reuse <code>cloudmesh-sbatch</code> which\nallows the creation of a number of subdirectories that contain a\nmodified <code>config.yaml</code> file, as well as a custom-created batch\nscript. We also have modified the original python code to take into\nconsideration the new parameters in the YAML file.  This framework can\nbe adapted to various applications and HPC computers on which we\nexecute cloudmask.</p>\n<p>For more information, please contact Gregor von Laszewski\n<a href=\"mailto:laszewski@gmail.com\">laszewski@gmail.com</a></p>\n<p>Code for cloudmesh-sbatch is available on\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cloudmesh-sbatch/\">GitHub and PyPi</a>.</p>\n",
