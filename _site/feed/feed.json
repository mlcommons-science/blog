			"content_html": "<p>The original cloudmask code contains a feature to save the training model into\na file that is later used for inference. However at the current time\nthe configuration file and the associated code save this configuration\nfile into a single location. If run in parallele the model would be\noverwritten among parallel runs. To allow parallel execution of\ncloudmask a mechanism to run the code on a permutation of different\nparameters is used. Fort this we can reuse <code>cloudmesh-sbatch</code> which\nallows the creation of a number of subdirectories that contain a\nmodified congig.yaml file, as well as a custom creates slurm\nscript. We also have modified the original python code to take in\nconsideration the new paramaters in the YAML file.\nThis framework can be adapted to various applications and HPC\ncomputers on which we execute cloudmask.</p>\n<p>For more information, please contact Gregor von Laszewski\n<a href=\"mailto:laszewski@gmail.com\">laszewski@gmail.com</a></p>\n<p>Code for cloudmesh-sbatch is available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cloudmesh-sbatch/\">GitHub and PyPi</a>.</p>\n",
