The goal of the MLCommons Research Science working group is to produce
artifacts that help advance science. These artifacts are structured as
benchmarks with datasets, reference model(s), and goals that cover
Science Research and Education. The primary goal is that our
benchmarks inspire research that achieves better scientific discovery
accuracy .through our benchmarks. However, training students by using
our artifacts in classes is also important. In this case, you can
submit either a report on the class or class notes that use our
artifacts to train the new scientists who will advance
discovery. Unlike other MLCommons groups, we do not have a closed
division but just the Research and Education open division that can
accept multiple types of submissions. We will index all submissions
and group them together into types of submissions. We only maintain a
leaderboard for scientific accuracy submissions. Note in some
inference examples, system performance needs to be improved to advance
science directly. Examples here include deep learning models for
microstructure in fluid calculations that must be invoked at every
grid point. Another example is online data analysis to select
interesting events in real time. Our GitHub is used to submit
artifacts for each submission, as in MLPerf training and
inference. But we also offer a wiki-like interface for you to describe
your submissions. Sometimes you may only need the latter if, for
example, you are describing a class use of our benchmark artifacts
without modification. The working group insists that all submissions
are properly described with metadata so we can help advance this
accessibility agenda.
